Shortest-Path Single-Source Algorithm (SSSP)
This sub-repository contains implementations of various single-source shortest-path algorithms, including Dijkstra's algorithm, for finding the shortest paths from a single source node to all other nodes in a weighted directed acyclic graph (DAG).

dijkstar.py is the main file that implements Dijkstra's algorithm.
