# Red-Black Tree README

A Red-Black Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that maintains balanced properties through color-coding of nodes. It ensures that the tree remains approximately balanced after insertion and deletion operations, guaranteeing logarithmic time complexity for basic operations.

## Properties of Red-Black Trees

A Red-Black Tree has the following properties:

1. **Node Color**: Each node is either red or black.
2. **Root and Leaf Colors**: The root and leaves (null or sentinel nodes) are black.
3. **Red-Black Properties**: Red nodes cannot have red children (no consecutive red nodes in any path).
4. **Black Height**: Every path from a node to its descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes (black height).

These properties ensure that the longest possible path from the root to any leaf is no more than twice as long as the shortest possible path, maintaining a balance that guarantees efficient operations.

## Insertion and Deletion

Inserting and deleting nodes in a Red-Black Tree involves enforcing the Red-Black properties while performing the standard binary search tree insertion and deletion. After these operations, additional adjustments are made to restore the balance of the tree by performing rotations and recoloring nodes.

## Algorithm Complexity

Red-Black Trees provide efficient time complexity for basic operations, as long as the tree remains balanced:

- **Insertion**: O(log n) - Inserting a node requires O(log n) rotations and recoloring operations.
- **Deletion**: O(log n) - Deleting a node also requires O(log n) rotations and recoloring operations.
- **Search**: O(log n) - Searching for a value in a Red-Black Tree has a similar time complexity to a regular binary search tree.

## Advantages and Use Cases

Red-Black Trees are used in scenarios where self-balancing properties are necessary for efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations. They are widely used in language libraries (e.g., C++'s `std::map` and `std::set`) and databases to maintain ordered data structures.

## Conclusion

Red-Black Trees provide an effective way to maintain balance in binary search trees, ensuring efficient performance for fundamental operations. Understanding the properties, insertion, and deletion procedures of Red-Black Trees is important for designing and optimizing data structures that require dynamic ordering and frequent data manipulation.
