### Quick Sort:

-Time Complexity: Average-case time complexity is O(n log n), but worst-case time complexity is O(n^2).
however Quick Sort is pretty fast and efficient in practical scenarios the worst-case running time of Quick Sort is almost always avoided by using what we call a randomized version of Quick Sort
-Space Complexity: Quick Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it requires only a small amount of additional memory beyond the input list itself.




### Merge Sort:

-Time Complexity: Consistent time complexity of O(n log n) in all cases, including the worst case.
-Space Complexity: Merge Sort requires additional memory to store temporary sublists during the merging process, making it less memory-efficient.


#### In summary, Quick Sort has a better average-case time complexity, but its worst-case time complexity is worse. Quick Sort is an in-place algorithm, while Merge Sort requires additional memory for temporary storage. The choice between them depends on factors such as the expected data distribution, stability requirements, and available memory resources.
