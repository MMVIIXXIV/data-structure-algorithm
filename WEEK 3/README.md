# Heap Sort README

Heap Sort is an efficient comparison-based sorting algorithm that takes advantage of the properties of a binary heap data structure. It works by creating a max-heap (or min-heap, depending on the sorting order) from the input array and repeatedly extracting the maximum (or minimum) element from the heap and placing it in the sorted portion of the array.

## How Heap Sort Works

Heap Sort operates through the following steps:

1. **Build Heap**: Convert the input array into a binary heap. This involves rearranging the elements to satisfy the heap property.
2. **Heapify**: Repeatedly extract the root element (maximum or minimum) from the heap and replace it with the last element. Then, perform a heapify operation to maintain the heap property.
3. **Repeat**: Repeat the heapify step until the heap is empty, and the sorted portion of the array is built.

Heap Sort can be implemented using either a max-heap or a min-heap, depending on whether you want to sort in ascending or descending order.

## Algorithm Complexity

Heap Sort offers a consistent time complexity and is relatively efficient for large datasets:

- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) - Heap Sort's build heap operation takes O(n) time, and the heapify step is performed n times (for each element). Therefore, the total time complexity is O(n log n).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - Heap Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it doesn't require additional memory proportional to the input size.

## Advantages and Use Cases

Heap Sort's consistent time complexity and in-place sorting behavior make it a suitable choice for scenarios where a stable sort isn't necessary. It is often used in situations where memory constraints are important or when external memory is involved.

## Conclusion

Heap Sort is an effective sorting algorithm that leverages the properties of a binary heap. By understanding how Heap Sort builds the heap and maintains it during extraction, you can appreciate its efficiency and apply it to sorting tasks effectively. Be aware that Heap Sort may not be the optimal choice when stability or external memory constraints are a concern.
