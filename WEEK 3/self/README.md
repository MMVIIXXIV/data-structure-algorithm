This code uses the QuickSort algorithm to sort a list of numbers. The algorithm works by following these steps:

Choose a pivot element from the list.
Partition the list into two parts: elements less than or equal to the pivot and elements greater than the pivot.
Recursively apply the same process to the sublists until the entire list is sorted.
The code consists of two functions:

partition: This function takes a list (arr), a start index (start), and an end index (end). It selects the last element of the list as the pivot and rearranges the elements in the list such that all elements less than or equal to the pivot come before the pivot, and all elements greater than the pivot come after it. Finally, it returns the index of the pivot element after the rearrangement.

QuickSort: This function takes a list (arr), a start index (start), and an end index (end). It first checks if there is more than one element in the sublist (i.e., start < end). If so, it calls the partition function to find the pivot index. Then, it recursively calls itself to sort the sublists before and after the pivot index.

At the end of the code, a list (arr) is initialized with some numbers. The QuickSort function is called with the appropriate parameters to sort the list. Finally, the sorted list is printed.
