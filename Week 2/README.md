# Merge Sort README

Merge Sort is a classic divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that works by recursively dividing an array into two halves, sorting each half, and then merging the sorted halves back together. It is known for its stable sorting behavior and consistent performance across various input scenarios.

## How Merge Sort Works

Merge Sort operates through the following steps:

1. **Divide**: The input array is divided into two equal (or almost equal) halves.
2. **Conquer**: Each half is recursively sorted using Merge Sort.
3. **Merge**: The sorted halves are merged back together into a single sorted array.

The merging step is a critical component of Merge Sort. It involves comparing elements from both halves and placing them in the correct order to create a single sorted array.

## Algorithm Complexity

Merge Sort offers a time complexity of O(n log n), making it more efficient than many other sorting algorithms. This efficiency remains consistent across various input distributions, making it suitable for large datasets.

- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) - Merge Sort divides the array into two halves log n times, and each division requires linear time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) - Merge Sort requires additional memory to store the divided subarrays during sorting.

## Advantages and Use Cases

Merge Sort's consistent performance makes it a suitable choice in scenarios where stable sorting and predictable time complexity are required. It is often used in external sorting where data doesn't fit entirely in memory, as well as in scenarios where preserving the relative order of equal elements is important.

## Conclusion

Merge Sort is a reliable sorting algorithm that demonstrates the divide-and-conquer paradigm. Its consistent performance and stable sorting behavior make it a valuable tool in various applications. By understanding how Merge Sort works and its time and space complexities, you can better appreciate its strengths and choose it appropriately for sorting tasks.
