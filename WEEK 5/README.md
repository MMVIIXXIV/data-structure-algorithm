# Time complexity

 The time complexity of various operations in a hash table implementation with chaining depends on several factors, including the size of the hash table (table_size), the number of elements (n) stored in the hash table, and the distribution of keys and values. Here's a breakdown of the time complexity for each operation:

    Insertion (insert function):

    Best Case: O(1) - If there are no collisions and the hash function evenly distributes keys, insertion can be constant time.
    Average Case: O(1 + α) - In a well-distributed hash table with chaining, where α (load factor) is the average number of elements per bucket,
     insertion can be considered constant time with a small factor due to possible collision resolution.
    Worst Case: O(n) - In the worst case, when all keys hash to the same bucket and create a long chain, insertion time degrades to linear time.
    Search (search function):

    Best Case: O(1) - If there are no collisions and the desired key is in the first position of its bucket, search can be constant time.
    Average Case: O(1 + α) - Similar to insertion, the average case is constant time with a small factor due to possible collisions.
    Worst Case: O(n) - In the worst case, when all keys hash to the same bucket, and a long chain forms, search time degrades to linear time.
    Deletion (delete function):

    Best Case: O(1) - If there are no collisions and the desired key is in the first position of its bucket, deletion can be constant time.
    Average Case: O(1 + α) - Similar to insertion and search, the average case is constant time with a small factor due to possible collisions.
    Worst Case: O(n) - In the worst case, when all keys hash to the same bucket, and a long chain forms, deletion time degrades to linear time.
