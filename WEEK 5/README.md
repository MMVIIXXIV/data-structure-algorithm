# Hash Table README

A hash table is a widely-used data structure that provides fast access to data by using a hash function to map keys to indices in an array. It is also known as a hash map. Hash tables are efficient for operations like insertion, deletion, and search, making them a fundamental component in computer science.

## How Hash Tables Work

A hash table consists of an array of buckets, each of which can store one or more key-value pairs. The hash function takes a key as input and calculates an index (hash code) within the array. The value is then stored at that index.

Collisions can occur when two different keys generate the same hash code, leading to conflicts. Hash tables implement collision resolution techniques to handle these cases. Some common methods include separate chaining (using linked lists at each index) and open addressing (probing for the next available index).

## Operations

1. **Insertion**: To insert a key-value pair into a hash table, the hash function is applied to the key to determine the index. If a collision occurs, the chosen collision resolution strategy is used to find the next available slot.

2. **Search**: Searching for a value involves applying the hash function to the key to locate the index. If a collision occurred during insertion, the collision resolution method is used to locate the value.

3. **Deletion**: Deleting a key-value pair requires finding the corresponding index using the hash function. If a collision occurred, the appropriate collision resolution technique is used to locate the value for deletion.

## Time Complexity

In an ideal scenario, hash table operations have a constant-time complexity of O(1). However, this assumes a good hash function and a minimal number of collisions. In the worst case, when many collisions occur, the performance can degrade to O(n), where n is the number of elements in the hash table.

## Conclusion

Hash tables are versatile data structures that provide efficient data access and manipulation. Choosing an appropriate hash function and handling collisions effectively are key factors in maintaining the performance of hash tables. Understanding the mechanics of hash tables is crucial for designing and optimizing algorithms that require fast data retrieval.
